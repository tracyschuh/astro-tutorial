<p>Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.</p>

<h2>What I've accomplished</h2>
<!-- when importing layout in frontmatter with slot, change to real html elements so special chars are rendered properly -->

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

<h2>What's next</h2>

<p>I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.</p>
